# It's All Made Up and the Points Don't Matter

During a trial, there's going to be a list of dogs in their Running order.
One by one, they will run and a trial admin will input the dog's score.

| Armband Number |  string   | This is an archaic uuid, but for some stupid reason, it's required by AKC. It's a 5 digit number, with the first two digits representing the dog's jump height, and the last three digits repping the dog for the whole day. SO, 12069 would be a 12 inch dog, running 69th of the day. This can be calculated once trial secretary locks in the order for the trial in the days before trail day |
